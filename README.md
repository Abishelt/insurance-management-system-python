# Insurance Management System (Python)

## Overview
A Python-based insurance management system that models customers, policies, claims, and agents. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming, data handling, and workflow simulation for a business domain.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (object-oriented design, data structures)
- GitHub + VS Code (version control, reproducible workflows)
- Business concepts (policy management, claims processing, customer records)

## Key Features
- Classes for Customers, Policies, Claims, and Agents
- Methods to create, update, and manage insurance records
- Simulation of policy issuance and claims handling
- Modular design for scalability and future integration

## Business Value
This project shows how Python can be used to model real-world business processes. It highlights your ability to translate requirements into code, automate workflows, and create systems that support decision-making in insurance operations.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open in VS Code  
3. Run `main.py` to simulate insurance workflows  
4. Review outputs for customer, policy, and claim management  

## Learning Outcomes
- Strengthened skills in Python OOP and modular design  
- Gained experience modeling business processes in code  
- Improved ability to document and structure projects for clarity and reproducibility
